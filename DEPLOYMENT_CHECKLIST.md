```

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] All 4 steps complete successfully
- [ ] Success rate = 100%
- [ ] EXECUTION_SUMMARY.txt created
- [ ] All reports generated
- [ ] All visualizations created
- [ ] No critical errors

## 📊 Output Validation

### SQL Queries Validation
```powershell
# Test a simple query
python -c "import sqlite3, pandas as pd; conn = sqlite3.connect('healthcare_analytics.db'); df = pd.read_sql_query('SELECT COUNT(*) as total FROM healthcare_patients', conn); print(df)"
```

**Expected:**
- [ ] Query returns valid number
- [ ] No SQL syntax errors
- [ ] Results match dataset

### Report Quality Checks

- [ ] Excel file opens without errors
- [ ] Contains 4 sheets minimum
- [ ] Data is properly formatted
- [ ] Numbers are reasonable

**Data Quality Report:**
- [ ] Quality score is between 0-100
- [ ] Critical columns are identified
- [ ] Issues are documented
- [ ] Recommendations provided

**Visualizations:**
- [ ] All images open correctly
- [ ] Charts have titles and labels
- [ ] Data is properly plotted
- [ ] Colors and legends visible

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Tests

### Test 1: Missing Dependencies
```powershell
# Simulate missing pandas
pip uninstall pandas -y
python Scripts/data_quality_validator.py
# Expected: Clear error message about missing pandas
pip install pandas
```

### Test 2: Missing Dataset
```powershell
# Rename dataset temporarily
Rename-Item "Dataset/HEALTHCARE PATIENT DATSET.csv" "Dataset/BACKUP.csv"
python Scripts/setup_database.py
# Expected: FileNotFoundError with helpful message
Rename-Item "Dataset/BACKUP.csv" "Dataset/HEALTHCARE PATIENT DATSET.csv"
```

### Test 3: Database Corruption
```powershell
# Delete database
Remove-Item healthcare_analytics.db -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
python Scripts/weekly_performance_report.py --mode once
# Expected: Automatically recreates database
```
